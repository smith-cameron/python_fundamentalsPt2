# < Named Arguments & Default Parameters
#* no arguments are provided -- the defaults are used
#* one unnamed argument provided -- provided value is used as the value for the first parameter, and the second parameter's default value is used
#* one named argument provided -- provided value is used as the value of the parameter of the same name, and the other parameter's default value is used
#* both unnamed arguments provided -- values assigned to parameters in order (i.e. what we've been doing up to this point)
#* both named arguments provided -- values are assigned to associated parameters (and then order doesn't matter!)
